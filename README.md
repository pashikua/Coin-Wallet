## What

Coin Wallet is a small iOS app that makes checking crypto currency prices and managing your portfolio easy.


## Why

- Making it Free and without Ads
- Exploring Open Source
- Improve my coding skills


## Open Source & Copying

I ship Coin Wallet on the App Store for free and provide its entire source code for free as well. In the spirit of openness, I have licensed my work under MIT so that you can use my code in your app, if you choose.

However, I ask that you **please do not ship this app** under your own account. Paid or free.
